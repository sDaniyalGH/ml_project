DDoS Attack Detection in SDN (Paper Implementation)


· Successfully reproduced the results of the paper ”ML Approach Equipped with Neighbourhood Component Analysis for
DDoS Attack Detection in SDN”.
· Implemented the full pipeline including Preprocessing, One-Hot Encoding, and Neighborhood Components Analysis
(NCA) to identify critical traffic features.
· Trained KNN, SVM, ANN, and Decision Tree models using the selected features.
· Proposed and implemented an improved Ensemble Learning model (Random Forest & Decision Tree) which outperformed
the original paper’s architecture.
